# Treaty

A gem to use pact-verifier via FFI in order to support the latest pact features.

Should be a replacement for `pact-ruby`, but most likely is very much incompatible
due to large specification differences.

:warning: This is just me hacking around with `ffi` and the pact verifier. Do not use this project.
