# Treaty

A gem to use pact-verifier via FFI in order to support the latest pact features.

Should be a replacement for `pact-ruby`, but most likely is very much incompatible
due to large specification differences.

:> [!WARNING]
> Only CRuby is supported!

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add treaty
